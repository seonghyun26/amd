forcefield: amber99sb-ildn  # amber99sb-ildn defines ACE+NME caps; charmm27 uses CT3 (incompatible with this PDB)
water_model: none          # vacuum simulation (no solvent)
box_type: dodecahedron
box_distance: 1.5          # nm — matches editconf -d 1.5 in prepare.sh

# Paths are resolved against work_dir by run_metadynamics.py / the agent
# prepare.sh copies ala2.gro and topol.top into the run directory.
